# Code Breaker

A mastermind inspired game.

## What I Did

- [x] main.js - All game work backend
- [x] main.css - updated and added to file for styling
- [x] index.html - given at point of fork, made improvements (e.g. made it browser responsive, fixed grids, making legend more clear, auto clear input form after guessing, allowed enter key to submit guess from input box)
